You need an AWS account to run the stack. The client applications using the stack need an AWS account too if you follow the best practice of segregating environments (recommended in production).

For the purpose of this "Getting started" documentation, we will run both the Stack and one Client app on the same AWS account. You could do that in production too, but it is not recommended.

### AWS entitlements

You must create a user on your AWS account. Give it the proper rights so it can use both SWF and SQS. Save its KEY and SECRET **securely** so you can use them to start the CPE stack.

### SQS queues

Create Two SQS queues:

   - **input queue:** Your client app will send commands to this queue
   - **output queue:** CPE will send output to this queue

Use the name you want for your queues. You will reference those queues in the `pollers` configuration file.

For more information about SQS queues creation and entitlements, see: [SQS Entitlements](/extra/sqs-entitlements.html)
