You need an AWS account to run the stack. The client applications using the stack need an AWS account too.

For the purpose of this "Getting started" documentation, we will run both the Stack and one Client on the same AWS account.

You could do that in production too, but it is recommended to segregate the Stack and the clients in separate AWS accounts.

### AWS entitlements

You must create a user on your AWS account. Give it the proper rights so it can use SWF and SQS.

Save its KEY and SECRET **securely** so you can use them to start the CPE stack.

### SQS queues

Create Two SQS queues:

   - input queue: Your client app will send commands to this
   - output queue: CPE will send output to this

Use the name you want. Those queues will be used for communications between CPE and the client.
