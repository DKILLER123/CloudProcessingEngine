The decider polls for decision tasks from the Decision TaskList it listens to on SWF (See SWF documentation). Decisions tasks are like:

   - WorkflowStarted
   - ActivityTaskFailed
   - ActivityTaskTerminated
   - WorkflowTerminated
   - etc

Based on those decision tasks (events), the decider makes decisions on what do to:

   - Start a new activity task
   - Cancel a workflow
   - etc

### More info
