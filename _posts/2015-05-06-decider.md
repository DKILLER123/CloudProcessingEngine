The decider polls for decision tasks from the SWF Decision TaskList referenced by the command line (See SWF documentation). The decider decides "what's next" in your workflow. The workflow is define through a YAML plan (detailed below).

**Decisions tasks are SWF "events" like:**

   - WorkflowStarted
   - ActivityTaskFailed
   - ActivityTaskTerminated
   - WorkflowTerminated
   - etc

**Based on those decision tasks, the Decider will:**

   - Start a new activity task
   - Cancel a workflow
   - etc

### Overview

The decider's code is in Python not in PHP like the ActivityPoller and the InputPoller.<br>
**It has its own Git repository here:** https://github.com/sportarchive/CloudProcessingEngine-Decider

The Decider implements your workflow logic that you defined in a Plan. A Plan is the description of your Workflow steps.

To get a good understanding of what a Decider is, you MUST read the SWF documentation. See links below.

### Decider Plan

The workflow Plan is a YAML file that defines:

   - **Steps:** What are the Steps of your workflow? Are there steps dependent on one another? What is the input/ouput of those steps? The Steps define your workflow execution. The Decider follows those steps when it receives SWF Decision tasks. The first Decision Task is always `WorkflowExecutionStarted`.
   - **Activities:** What are the SWF activities that will execute your steps? You list the Activities names and version (See SWF documentation about activities). Each activity is registered in SWF. Activities are initiated by the Decider and executed by the ActivityPoller.

**Here is an example of a YAML Plan:**

```yaml
---
plan:
  name: MyWorkFlow
  version: 1.0

  activities:
  - name: MyAct1
    version: 1.0

  steps:
  - name: MyStep1
    input: |
        Input passed to MyAct1
    activity: MyAct1
```

The plan syntax allow to create dependencies between steps, set input and output data, perform JSON schemas validation and more.

To know all you can do with the Decider, see its documentation.<br>

### Dependencies

You need Python installed to run the Decider.

Before starting it, you need to install the dependencies:

```
$> cd CloudProcessingEngine/decider
$> ./setup.py install
```

If you try to run it, you should see the following:

```
$> cd CloudProcessingEngine/decider/bin
$> ./decider.py 
usage: decider.py [-h] -d DOMAIN -t TASK_LIST [--plan_name PLAN_NAME]
                  [--plan_version PLAN_VERSION] --plan PLAN
decider.py: error: argument -d/--domain is required
```

**To start the decider you need to:**

   - Specify the SWF Domain your workflow will run into. You can pre-create it in the SWF console, or the Decider will create it for you.
   - Specify the Decision TaskList the Decider will listen to. It's like a queue where decision events come in from SWF. See the SWF documentation.
   - Specify the filename that contains your YAML plan.

The decider logs are going into: `/var/tmp/log/cpe/decider.log`.

`tail -f` this log file to see the Decider in action.

### More info

The Decider is a project on its own. It is a git sub module of the CPE project.
